# android-tip-calc Tutorial

This application was developed as part of an assignment in my technical writing class where I had to create a set of instructions for any specific task. I decided to create a set of instructions that explains how to create a basic Android application. 

All of the steps needed to create the application are listed in the accompanying PDF file. It's recommended that you have at least a basic understanding of Java beforehand, but the specific steps are explained in a way that even someone without coding experience could complete the task.

The "MyApplication" folder contains the application I created while making the set of instructions.
